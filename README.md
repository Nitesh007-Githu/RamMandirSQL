A structured SQL database project modeling the Ram Mandir (Ayodhya), featuring entities such as deities, temple details, construction phases, architects, donations, and key events. 
It demonstrates relational database design with primary keys, foreign keys, and many-to-many relationships, supported by sample data and practical queries for analyzing donations, timelines,
architecture, and ceremonies. This project serves as a practical learning resource for SQL beginners to explore schema design, data insertion, and query writing in a real-world inspired 
context.
