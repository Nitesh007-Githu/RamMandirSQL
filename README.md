# Ram Mandir Database Modeling | SQL
Project Overview
A structured SQL database project modeling the Ram Mandir (Ayodhya), featuring entities such as deities, temple details, construction phases, architects, donations, and key events. The goal is to demonstrate relational database design and provide practical experience with SQL queries in a real-world inspired context.

## Project Steps

Designed the database schema with primary keys, foreign keys, and many-to-many relationships.

Populated the database with sample data for temples, deities, construction phases, architects, donations, and events.

Wrote queries to analyze donations, timelines, architectural details, and ceremonies.

Explored relational database operations, including data insertion, joins, filtering, and aggregations.

## Tools Used
SQL, MySQL (or preferred RDBMS), Sample Data

## Insights
Donations varied across construction phases and ceremonies.

Key architects and contributors were linked to specific milestones in temple construction.

Timeline analysis helped understand the sequence of events and construction progress.

## Result
The project provides a practical learning resource for SQL beginners to explore schema design, data insertion, and query writing in a structured, real-world inspired database scenario.
